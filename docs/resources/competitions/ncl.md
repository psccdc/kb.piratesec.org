## National Cyber League

The [National Cyber League (NCL)](https://www.nationalcyberleague.org) is a defensive and offensive puzzle-based, capture-the-flag style cybersecurity competition. Its virtual training ground helps high school and college students prepare and test themselves against cybersecurity challenges that they will likely face in the workforce. All participants play the games simultaneously during Preseason, Individual, and Team Games.

NCL challenges are based on the CompTIA Security+ and EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) performance-based exam objectives and include the following content: Open Source Intelligence, Scanning, Enumeration and Exploitation, Password Cracking, Traffic Analysis, Log Analysis, Wireless Security, Cryptography, and Web Application Security.

### Games

| Game | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
Preseason | Individual competition that allows the NCL to evaluate participants to determine their current skill level. After the preseason, players are placed into one of three brackets: Bronze, Silver and Gold. This allows students to compete in Regular Season with other similarly skilled participants.
| Individual | Another individual competition that pits players against each other in their assigned brackets. This is where player’s scores matter. Participants will be ranked overall and within their bracket.
| Team | Where Regular Season players form teams with 2 to 5 members to compete (no flag sharing with other teams). Various levels of experience and expertise are brought to the table in this situation. Many consider the Postseason game the highlight of their NCL experience. Each team’s bracket is determined by the average Regular Season score of the team’s members.

### Scoring

Players/teams participate in a type of computer security game called a Capture-the-Flag (CTF). In CTF games, players/teams race to answer security-related challenges, often searching for digital “flags" hidden on servers, in encrypted text, or in applications. Challenges within the CTF are open-ended and require expertise and skills in a wide range of security-related topics. When a player/teams submits a flag, they receive points for solving the challenge. The player/team with the highest cumulative score at the end of the game wins.

Players/teams are scored on their ability to successfully complete the challenges and obtain the flags therein. Most challenges in the Spring Season contain more than one flag. To accumulate points, players/teams receive a pre-assigned point value for successfully submitting a flag. The point value for some flags is determined by the NCL difficulty rating system. The total score for a player/team is the sum of points for all successfully submitted flags.

While game challenges are available to all players/teams, there are increasingly difficult challenges included to test players/teams with more advanced skills.

### Brackets

During the Individual and Team Game, NCL will place individual players and teams with similar knowledge and skill levels into one of 3 brackets as follows:

| Bracket | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Bronze | Novice players. Players will have limited existing knowledge and skills and should be able to complete some or most of the preparatory lab exercises
| Silver | Intermediate players. Players will have an intermediate level of knowledge and skills and should be able to complete all of the preparatory lab exercises
| Gold | Experienced players. Players will have the highest level of knowledge and skills (e.g., have already completed relevant certifications and/or completed more advanced study)

These brackets are determined by the following score requirements:

| Bracket | Score Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| Gold | Top 15% scored players or teams |
| Silver | Next 35% scored players or teams |
| Bronze | Remaining 50% scored players or teams |

#### Individual Game Brackets

All Individual Game players participate in a mandatory Preseason game. At the end of the Preseason game, all players’ scores are totaled and used to place players in the appropriate bracket. Players who fail to participate in the Preseason game are considered unqualified and will be unranked during the Individual Game.

#### Team Game Brackets

Once Team Game teams have been established, the score of the top performing player from the Individual Game in each team will be used to place the team in the appropriate bracket. Only the Individual Team score will be used to determine the bracket for the Team Game. Preseason scores are not considered.

### Gymnasium

The NCL Gym provides practice challenges to help prepare players for the Individual and Team Games. While practicing in the NCL Gym, players can access a solutions guide that includes step-by-step instructions to help them understand the more difficult challenges.

### Preseason Game

A goal of the NCL is to provide beginners with an entry point into cybersecurity games through preparatory exercises, while also challenging and engaging players who have already mastered similar content. As part of the Preseason, participant knowledge and skills will be assessed through a mandatory Preseason game. Based on the results of this game, players will be placed in one of three Brackets.

#### Fall 2018 Preseason Highlights

| Available Flags | 82 |
| Maximum Score | 1,510 |
| Total Attempts | 263,537 |
| Total Flag Captures | 160,181 |
| Total Student Participation | 3,373 |

### Individual Game

The Individual Game is the portion of the NCL where individuals compete on their own, without the assistance of others, to solve game challenges. The game challenges are aligned with preparatory exercises and allow participants to validate the knowledge and skills they are developing in the NCL Gymnasium. Flag-sharing is not allowed. 

#### Fall 2018 Individual Highlights

| Available Flags | 143 |
| Maximum Score | 3,000 |
| Total Attempts | 242,140 |
| Total Flag Captures | 160,857 |
| Total Student Participation | 2,671 |
| Total Coach Participation | 61 |

### Team Game

Real-world cybersecurity work is often done in teams. The NCL Team Game provides a safe and challenging environment for players from the Individual Game to apply their knowledge and skills in a team setting. The team game requires players to work together to solve real problems, with real deadlines, under time (and in some cases) technical and resource constraints. No flag-sharing with other teams allowed. [^1]
