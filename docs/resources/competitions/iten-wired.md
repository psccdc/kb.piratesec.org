## ITEN Wired Cybersecurity Competition

ITEN Wired in collaboration with University of West Florida's Center for Cybersecurity host the [ITEN Wired Cybersecurity Competition](https://itenwired.com/cybersecurity-competition/) every October during the ITEN Wired Summit. The first cybersecurity competition was held in 2016 where our own Pensacola State College Cyber Defense Club took first place.

Each year The UWF Center for Cybersecurity host's the competition in it's own Florida Cyber Range. In previous competitions each team was dropped into a poorly secured network where they act as incident responders. Teams would experience, document, and respond to various network attacks, testing their ability to detect, defend, and prevent various threats without prior preparations. Previously organizers had provided students with information in advance to prepare for the competition, however as of 2018 the organizers have refrained from releasing any details regarding the competition until the day of.

### Attack-Defend CTF

An Attack-Defend Capture the Flag, also known as a Combative Capture the Flag (CCTF) or Red Team/Blue Team event is a cybersecurity competition where each team attacks the other team's network resources while simultaneously defending their own. There are flags hidden throughout various network resources which attacking teams attempt to obtain while compromising various  systems such as routers, servers, and host machines. Attacking teams are able to utilize various resources in order to compromise defending machines within the rules of the competition.

### Jeopardy-Style CTF

A Jeopardy-Style Capture the Flag event is a knowledge based cybersecurity competition in which teams compete against one another in a question-answer format. Teams are given various categories to choose from containing cybersecurity related questions. Each question is assigned a point value according to the relative difficulty. Some categories include: cryptography, steganography, physical security, and network scanning.
